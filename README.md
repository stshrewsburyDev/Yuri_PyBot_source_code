The Source Code For Yuri PyBot Used By Heroku To Host The Bot.


## NOTICE: 
This code is extremely bad and the layout is terrible.

I make way better looking code now and I am doing a re-write of this bot very soon, i would recommend not using this code layout if you are using this as reference since even though the actual command code is good, all the code is within one main ``bot.py`` file making it very hard to find certain commands or functions.

The new rewrite will use ``cogs`` to be able to enhance the performance of the bot aswell as the code.

Also the commands under the ``class MusicBot:`` do not work very well and I am going to try and make them work better than they currently do. (these are lines 1181-1433)

___UPDATE:___
The music ```y!play URL/searchTerm``` was failing to work as I was using a outdated youtube_dl client version, note to self: "make sure to update your stuff :D"

If you are currently looking for a music bot command feature, consider looking at the official ``discord.py`` repository [here](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) for the source code of ``discord.py``

Or you can go to an example by Rapptz (the developer of ``discord.py``) of a music function [here!](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/blob/master/examples/basic_voice.py)
